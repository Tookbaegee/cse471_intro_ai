# Description: py file defining shopSmart method which is called by main. the function takes orderList, the list of two-tuple element, fruit and number of pounds, 
#               and calculates the cost of the total fruits in the orderList based on the price tag given by the dictionary of each shop objects. 
#               The method calls the getPriceOfOrder defined in shop class, and calculates the index of the shop array, for which shop
#               object has the cheapest total price to buy the fruits in orderList.
